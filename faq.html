      <label for="faq1"
        >Q: Does this script use TeamSpeak or other VOIP services?</label
      >
      <div class="faq-content">
        <p>
          A: No! SCNP25 is 100% fully self-reliant and does not require any 3rd
          party service.
        </p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <input type="checkbox" id="faq2" />
      <label for="faq2"
        >Q: "I accidentally pressed "deny" instead of "allow" the first time I
        joined the server and now nobody can hear me. How do I fix?"</label
      >
      <div class="faq-content">
        <p>
          A: This is actually pretty common, don't be worried though, it's an
          easy fix! Open windows explorer and navigate to the following path:
          %AppData%\CitizenFX Then, delete the file named: media_access.json to
          reset all permissions. Next time you log in to the server, you should
          see the prompt.

    <div class="faq-item">
      <input type="checkbox" id="faq3" />
      <label for="faq3"
        >Q: "I pressed "allow" and people are not hearing me. I tried everything
        and I can't get it to work"</label
      >
      <div class="faq-content">
        <p>
          A: Windows can be a pain sometimes, try reconfiguring your sound
          settings on your PC. Primarily your "default communications device"
          under the "recording" tab in sound control panel.

    <div class="faq-item">
      <input type="checkbox" id="faq4" />
      <label for="faq4"
        >Q: After pulling up my radio for the first time, I see "Out Of Rng" on
        screen</label
      >
      <div class="faq-content">
        <p>
          A: Try going to Sandy Shores PD and see if the issue persists. If you
          still see "Out Of Rng", ensure sure you do not have any VPN/Proxy
          running on your system as we block these types of connections due to
          abuse.

    <div class="faq-item">
      <input type="checkbox" id="faq5" />
      <label for="faq5"
        >Q: When I pull up the F8 console I notice errors in red for: scnp25,
        radio or watchdog. What do I do to fix these errors?</label
      >
      <div class="faq-content">
        <p>
          A: If the radio is functioning normally, just disregard these errors.
          It's probably something to do with network lag and isn't important to
          the end-user. THIS MEANS ITS NOT AN ERROR
        </p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <input type="checkbox" id="faq6" />
      <label for="faq6">Q: Does this work with ___ framework?</label>
      <div class="faq-content">
        <p>A: Yes! SCNP25 works will most frameworks!</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <input type="checkbox" id="faq7" />
      <label for="faq7">Q: Is the audio intentionally "distorted"?</label>
      <div class="faq-content">
        <p>
          A: NO, the audio is not tampered with in any form. It's passed through
          the codec and sent back to the client.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <input type="checkbox" id="faq8" />
      <label for="faq8">Q: What is "Legacy Audio Mode"?</label>
      <div class="faq-content">
        <p>
          A: Legacy Audio Mode is a deprecated codec that will be removed from
          the script entirely in a future update.
        </p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <input type="checkbox" id="faq9" />
      <label for="faq9"
        >Q: Can the PTT animation be turned off or modified?</label
      >
      <div class="faq-content">
        <p>
          A: At this time, you can't turn off or modify the PTT animation but,
          we're looking into this for a future update.
        </p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <input type="checkbox" id="faq10" />
      <label for="faq10"
        >Q: A player pressed their emergency button and left the server without
        clearing it so now we're constantly hearing the beeping. Can we clear
        it?</label
      >
      <div class="faq-content">
        <p>
          A: If a user activates their emergency there are a few ways to clear
          it. 1) The user can press the button again to clear it. 2) Dispatchers
          have the "CL/EMG" button which will acknowledge & clear the emergency.
          3) If the user left the server and forgot to clear it, you can use
          /trsResetEmergency to force clear all emergency activations that are
          currently active.
        </p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <input type="checkbox" id="faq11" />
      <label for="faq11"
        >Q: Some of my users (or me) sound muffled and/or have super low audio
        even with my volume at 100%.</label
      >
      <div class="faq-content">
        <p>
          A: This is a common thing and it's pretty simple to fix. First, ensure
          you're speaking calmly & clearly. If you yell and talk too fast,
          nobody can understand you (and that's not just an SCNP25 thing, that's
          everywhere). Second, ensure you (or your users) aren't mumbling. We
          hear this a lot and, just because that's "how you hear it on a
          scanner" doesn't mean it's good radio etiquette. Lastly, ensure your
          windows audio device (specifically your mic) has a good output level.
          Low audio output = definite issues.
